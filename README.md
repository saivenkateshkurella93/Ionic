# Ionic Mobile Hybrid App - Event/Conference Info App
This is a Hybrid mobile application built Using Ionic Framework,Apache Cordova and Ionic Framework.
This App is successfully deployed in Mobile.

# About this App
This app was built to serve any events, conferences, hackathons, etc.
This app shows information about the events to be taken place in that day, about the speakers, presenters, schedule etc.
This is a cross platform compatible mobile application built using Ionic Framework.
The main idea behind this application is provide all the details, updates for the event. Push notifications have also been implemented. This repository includes screenshots of the screens in the app.

# Technologies used in this App & Implementation

- Ionic Framework: Ionic is an open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development. It is a powerful HTML5 SDK that helps to build native-feeling mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Apache Cordova: Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript.
- cordova-sqlite-storage: Cross-platform SQLite storage plugin for Cordova
- AngularJS
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS3

The implementation was all component based. I initially made a skeleton structure of the app and then kept adding the components, data and connections into the application. The aim was to accommodate all the information that a guest would need when he/she attends the event, also enabling push notifications so that users would not miss out any announcements, important updates regarding the event. This application also has Google maps API integrated to show the venue address. This is a naive, yet successful attempt to get familiar with Hybrid mobile application development.

# Improvements and Future work

- Update to latest Ionic and Angular versions.
- Lay more emphasis on the UX.
- Deploy the application in a server, connect with the databases of the event organization.
- Write unit test cases to make the app more secured.
